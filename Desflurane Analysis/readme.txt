comparison of hemodynamic and respiratory parameters between low flow and medium flow anaesthesia with Desflurane.

Desflurane is a costly and effective anaesthetic drug. Cost effectiveness is more when given with low oxygen flow of 1 L. But it's quite risky. Objective is to show that this low oxygen flow is as good as medium oxygen flow of 1.5 L.
